Note:
-this is an info list so you know what dependancies are already installed in node_modules and available to use
-you do NOT need to add these dependances on your machine, they are already in node_modules now
-if you add any dependancies to your branch, please add to this list for the sake of being informed
-if any of them throw an error, let me know, but you can probably just try doing another yarn add or yarn upgrade

react-router
	--yarn add react-router
	--we will be using HashRouter, only needs imported on App.js and is done
react-router-dom
	--yarn add react-router-dom
react-icons
	--yarn add react-icons

uuid
	--import { v4 as uuid } from 'uuid';
sass
	--sass is a global install, not a dependancy, so if you do not have sass, install using yarn
	--the command to start sass is: `sass --watch <path-to>/src/sass/style.scss <path-to>/src/style.css`
